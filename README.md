# Tic-tac-toe game project

## Summary

I built this game as my initial Web Development Immersive (WDI) course project at General Assembly. The primary programs I used were HTML5, Sass and JavaScript, with some Bootstrap.

Technical Specifications
- Custom game engine
- Single page application

## Features
Players can play on the same desktop or mobile device, alternating who clicks on which squares. The game visually notifies which side won, or if the game ended in a draw. When a player wins, the game board's border color changes to the color of that player's pieces.

## User Stories
- As a visitor to the game's website, I need to see the game presented clearly so that I know how to start playing.

- As a game player starting a new game, I need to be aware of who the other player is so that I know which one of us plays the first move.

- As a game player during gameplay, I want to see confirmation on whose move it is so that I know whether to select a square or wait for the other player.

- As a game player at the end of a game, I want to see the final board with the winning player identified so that I know who won the game.

- As a game player who has just completed a game, I want to know where to click so that I can play a new game.

## Future Features
I would like to add functionality so that a user can sign up with an account and interact with an API.
