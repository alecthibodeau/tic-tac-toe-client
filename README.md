# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

## Summary

I built this game as my initial Web Development Immersive (WDI) course project at General Assembly. The primary programs I used were HTML5, CSS/Sass and JavaScript, with some Bootstrap for work with modals.

Technical Specifications
- Custom game engine
- Single page application
- Multiple games, one at a time
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
- AJAX for interacting with a provided API
- Responsive web design with original styling

## Features
Players can play on the same desktop or mobile device, alternating who clicks on which squares. The game visually notifies which side won, or if the game ended in a draw. When a player wins, the game board's border color changes to the color of that player's pieces.

## User Stories
- As a visitor to the game's website, I need to see how to authenticate (sign up and sign in) so that I can access the game.

- As a signed-in player I need to know what my options are so that I can either start playing a game, change my password, get game stats or sign out.

- As a signed-in player I need to know how to start a new game so that I can begin playing.

- As a game player during gameplay, I want to see confirmation on whose move it is so that I know whether to select a square or wait for the other player to move.

- As a game player at the end of a game, I want to see the final board with the winning player identified so that I know who won the game.

- As a game player who has just completed a game, I want to know where to click so that I can play a new game.

## Future Features
- Add an AI component, so that a signed-in user can play against the computer.
