# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

## Summary

I built this game as my initial Web Development Immersive (WDI) course project at General Assembly. The primary programs I used were HTML5, CSS/Sass and JavaScript, with some Bootstrap for work with modals.

Technical Specifications
- Custom game engine
- Single page application
- Multiple games, one at a time
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
- AJAX for interacting with a provided API
- Responsive web design with original styling

## Features
One player can play against the computer. Or two human players can play against each other on the same desktop or mobile device, alternating who clicks on which squares. The game visually identifies which player won, or if the game ended in a draw. When a player wins, the game board's border color changes to the color of that player's pieces: red for X, blue for O.

## User Stories
- As a visitor to the website wishing to play a game I need to know how to start a new game: either against the computer or against another human.

- As a game player during gameplay, I want to see confirmation on whose move it is so that I know whether to select a square or wait for the other player to move.

- As a game player at the end of a game, I want to see the final board with the winning player identified so that I know who won the game.

- As a game player who has just completed a game, I want to know where to click so that I can play a new game, reset the score or both.

- As a game player wishing to save my game stats I need to see how to authenticate (sign up and sign in) so that I can create a user account.

- As a signed-in player I need to know what my options are so that I can either start playing a game, change my password, get game stats or sign out.

## Future Features
- I'd like to refine the AI feature for various difficulty levels.
